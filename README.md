* Enter Activities:

  * 5 colors (shown as opacity): ... all effort gets some reward, extra effort gets extra reward.
  * 10% opacity = ANY effort
  * 30% opacity = 33% effort (? should this be more, 50% maybe?)
  * 50% opacity = 67% effort (? if other is 50% should this be 75%, 90%?)

  * 90% opacity > 100% effort
